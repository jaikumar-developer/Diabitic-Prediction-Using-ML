🩺 Diabetic Prediction Project
📌 Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health parameters using a machine learning model. The dataset used contains medical diagnostic data for female patients.

📁 Dataset
Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Features Used:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

NumPy, Pandas

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Joblib

📊 Data Preprocessing
Checked for missing values

Created correlation heatmap to identify strong features

Normalized/Standardized data (if needed)

🤖 Model Used
Model: Logistic Regression (or another model — please confirm)

Training: Used train_test_split to split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

📈 Visualization
Correlation Heatmap

Pairplot (optional)

Confusion Matrix Plot

💾 Model Deployment
Trained model was saved using joblib:

python
Copy
Edit
joblib.dump(model, "diabetic_dump.pk1")
The model was later used to make predictions on sample input:

python
Copy
Edit
loaded_model.predict([[1,85,66,29,0,26.6,0.351,31]])
✅ Prediction Result Mapping
python
Copy
Edit
out = {1: "Diabetic", 0: "Non-Diabetic"}
print(out[y_pred[0]])

# 🩺 Diabetic Prediction Project

A machine learning project that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on various health metrics using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Features Used**:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
- **Target Variable**: `Outcome` (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

---

## 📈 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Read dataset using `pandas`
   - Displayed dataset structure with `.info()` and `.shape()`

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Generated a heatmap of feature correlations using `sns.heatmap()`

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Divided the data using `train_test_split()` with 80% training and 20% testing

4. **Model Training**:
   - Used `LogisticRegression` for prediction
   - Trained using `.fit()`

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Made predictions on test data
   - Displayed results using a **confusion matrix** heatmap

6. **Model Saving**:
   - Trained model was saved using `joblib.dump()` as `diabetic_dump.pk1`

7. **Model Inference**:
   - Re-loaded the model using `joblib.load()`
   - Predicted a new sample:
     ```python
     loaded_model.predict([[6, 148, 72, 35, 0, 33.6, 0.627, 50]])
     ```

8. **Prediction Mapping**:
   ```python
   out = {0: "NA", 1: "Diabetic"}
   predicted_label = out.get(y_pred[0], "Unknown")
   print("Predicted Output:", predicted_label)
